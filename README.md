# interactive gallery and blog website
to create new blog pages, copy "blog1.html" and re-paste it with new file name.
after create new blog page redirect lines and link with them.
yes i know this is a boring solution but this is my website and u dont have permission eheh.

# coded with
css, basically normal javascript and html
u dont need to install any packages to start, only click "index.html"

# and everything ends, thanks.
